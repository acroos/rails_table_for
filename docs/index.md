# Introduciton

No more writing out dozens of <tr>, <th>, <td> elements.  Write a few lines of ruby code (or even a single line) and
get a lovely little table generated for you.  You can present data from your records directly with almost no work, or 
do a little customization if you'd like something extra special.  More features are coming soon, but pagination
already comes included (only if you want it).

# Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'rails_table_for'
```

And then execute:

```
$ bundle
```
